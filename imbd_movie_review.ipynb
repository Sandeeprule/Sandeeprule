            "? lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane ? satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in ? 18th century england northam and paltrow are a ? mixture as friends who must pass through ? and lies to discover that they love each other good humor is a ? virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the ? of the aged source material which has been toned down a bit in its harsh ? i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up and i thought it didn't rely too much on ? of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do very good results\n",
            "? just got out and cannot believe what a brilliant documentary this is rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and ? lately movies have become so over hyped that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens ? ? did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now i didn't know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise if you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those ? movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in ? this is not that movie the people tell the story this does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them there is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense touching the void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story i just saw it today but i will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen\n",
            "? french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and ? romance ? on to the scene ? ? the revival just slightly but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made ? was obviously shot on a low budget but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film and this in turn is ? by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic the central character is a man named ? sent to prison for fraud he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane ? body building ? marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy after a short while in the cell together they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old ? after ? part of it they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls br br black magic is a very interesting topic and i'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it it's fair to say that ? makes the best of it's ? as despite it's ? the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout director eric ? provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ? that the film feels very claustrophobic and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell it's very easy to get behind them it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really ? people and this film proves that as the director ? that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner and this helps to ensure that ? actually does manage to be quite frightening the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying overall ? is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade highly recommended viewing\n",
